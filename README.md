## Project Overview
This project is a baseline document classification system built using classical NLP techniques.
It is designed to be clear, modular, and scalable, focusing on proper ML project structure
rather than model complexity.

The project includes:
- Data loading and feature extraction
- Model training and evaluation
- Artifact saving/loading
- Inference on unseen data
- A simple REST API for model access
